# AdmitAI Korea - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview

We are building AdmitAI Korea, a revolutionary AI-powered college admissions platform specifically designed for Korean students applying to U.S. universities. Unlike generic AI essay analyzers that only look at the essay itself, we operate as "university admissions meteorologists" - using weather as an analogy to explain that we analyze the broader context and external factors (admissions policies, cultural atmosphere, academic priorities, financial aid changes, institutional values, market conditions, and policy shifts) that influence admissions decisions. Our core innovation is the "University Weather Strategy" where we provide real-time, university-specific intelligence that tells students exactly what each school is looking for this year, how to adapt their Korean cultural background for specific institutions, and when to apply for maximum impact. We combine cutting-edge AI (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Grammarly API) with deep cultural storytelling modules, bilingual interfaces (Korean/English), and comprehensive data collection from university sources, hagwon partnerships, and community submissions. Our competitive advantage lies in context-aware AI that doesn't just analyze writing, but analyzes the entire university ecosystem to provide context-specific recommendations. We're building the most comprehensive Korean student essay database while creating sustainable competitive advantages through data quality, cultural expertise, and network effects. The platform includes features like cultural storytelling modules, ESL improvement tools, parent dashboards, virtual mentor chatbots, and partnership systems for hagwons. Our goal is to transform Korean students from generic applicants into culturally authentic, strategically positioned candidates who understand and leverage each university's unique context and external factors for maximum admission success.
